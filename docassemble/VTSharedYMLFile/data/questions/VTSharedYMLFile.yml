######Some family-related templates######
template: what_is_legal_parental_rights
subject: |
  What is legal responsibility?
content: |
  Legal responsibility is who has the right to make major decisions about the child’s life. The major decisions tend to be about religion, education, medical care and travel outside of Vermont. Learn more on [VTLawHelp.org](https://vtlawhelp.org/custody-visitation).
---
template: what_is_physical_parental_rights
subject: |
  What is physical responsibility?
content: |
  Physical responsibility means who has the responsibility to provide routine daily care and control of the child and to make day-to-day decisions. Where the child physically lives is included in physical responsibility. Learn more on [VTLawHelp.org](https://vtlawhelp.org/custody-visitation).
---
template: what_is_parent_child_contact
subject: |
  What do these parent-child contact options mean?
content: |
  In Vermont, “parent-child contact” refers to the time a child spends with each parent. This is sometimes called parent-time or visitation. Generally, the courts prefer that children can spend as much time as possible with both of their parents. 

  Check “Parent-child contact for myself” if:
  
  - you want the child/children to live with you, **or**
  - you want to have the right to spend time with your child/children.

  Check “Parent-child contact for ${ other_parties[0] }” if:
  
  - you want the child/children to live with ${ other_parties[0] }, **or**
  - you want ${ other_parties[0] } to have the right to spend time with your child/children.

  You will have the chance to explain more about what you want -- or what you and ${ other_parties[0] } have agreed on -- in other divorce forms. Learn more on [VTLawHelp.org](https://vtlawhelp.org/custody-visitation).
---
template: what_is_child_medical_and_maintenance_support
subject: |
  What do these mean?
content: |
  * Child support -- It is paid by one parent to the other for the support of children. Parents are expected to support their children if they are able to.
  * Medical support -- Money for child medical care.
  * Maintenance supplement -- Money to correct a difference in the finances of the parents. This can happen if the court thinks the children will have a lower standard of living while living with one parent as compared to the other.
